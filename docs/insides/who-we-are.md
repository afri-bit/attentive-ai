## Our History

We are [__afri-bit__](https://github.com/afri-bit) and [__zennur__](https://github.com/zennur), and our journey began when we met at the first hackathon for Eclipse Software Defined Vehicles (SDV) in 2023 - [Eclipse SDV Hackathon](https://sdv.eclipse.org/sdv-hackathon-2023/). At that time, we were complete strangers, each bringing our own unique skills and perspectives to the table. Despite not knowing each other initially, we quickly found a synergy in our working styles.

Throughout the course of the project, we developed a remarkably autonomous way of collaborating. Each of us had a clear vision of our individual responsibilities and how they contributed to the overarching goals. This clarity and mutual understanding enabled us to work seamlessly and efficiently, leveraging our strengths to drive the project forward.

Our efforts culminated in a significant achievement: we won the hackathon. This victory was not just a testament to our technical skills and innovative ideas, but also to our ability to collaborate effectively under pressure. Winning the hackathon was a defining moment for us, solidifying our partnership and inspiring us to pursue further endeavors together.

This initial success set the stage for our ongoing collaboration and the development of the project you see today. It was more than just a win; it was the beginning of a journey marked by shared vision, mutual respect, and a relentless drive to push the boundaries of what we can achieve together.

## The Born of __*AlpacAI*__

The project originated from a renowned hackathon, the Bosch Connected Experience in early 2024, known as BCX24. It was during this event that we met in person for the second time, eager to push our limits in this larger and more challenging setting. BCX24 emphasized the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the digital realms of automotive and industrial sectors.

Faced with numerous topics to choose from, we found that none quite resonated with our instincts at first. We decided to take a step back and delve deeper into our own ideas. After several hours of intense brainstorming and discussion, we finally landed on a groundbreaking concept: 

!!! tip - "Increase Safety with Generative AI"
    *"Utilizing generative AI with Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance driver safety in the automotive field."*

This pivotal moment marked the birth of the __*AlpacAI*__ system. Our innovative solution aimed to integrate advanced AI technologies to predict and mitigate potential hazards, that are caused by the driver itself, in this case *the drowsiness level of the driver*, thereby significantly improving driver safety. The concept was ambitious, but it aligned perfectly with our skills and the vision we had for our collaborative efforts.

Our experience at BCX24 was not just about competing; it was about innovating and pushing the boundaries of what AI could achieve in real-world applications. The creation of AlpacAI represented a convergence of our passion for technology and our commitment to making a tangible impact. This project laid the foundation for our ongoing journey, driving us to continue exploring and developing AI solutions that can transform industries and improve lives.
